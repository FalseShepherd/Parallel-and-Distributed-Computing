# Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing
NOTE: this is a compilation of some Programs written for Parallel and Distributed Computing.

These programs are made to run in parallel and some will take advantage of either GPU acceleration or ditributed processing on a server 
based system in order to achieve faster compute times for large amounts of Data.

Most of these programs run primarily off java (or in the case of the OpeCL programs C++) however may require other Software in order to 
compile and run properly, such as;

Apache_Hadoop,
OpenCL,
OpenGL,
and C++
